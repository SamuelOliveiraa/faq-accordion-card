# Frontend Mentor - FAQ accordion card

![Design preview for the FAQ accordion card coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## WELCOME! ðŸ‘‹

This is a challenge proposed by the website **[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io)** and this site is great because it helps us improve our **coding skills** with real projects and more varied difficulties. The site gives us the possibility to train any skill or web technology that we want, be it media-querie, grid layout, Jquery, React, etc..

## The Challenge ðŸŽ¯

This challenge is to reproduce this **FAQ accordion card** as close as possible to the original design.

My biggest difficulties in this challenge was using and implementing the Jquery library, as it was the first time I used it, but despite everything I saw that this library is much easier to use and manipulate the DOM, I will definitely use it in others future projects.

## Technologies Used ðŸ§©

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JAVASCRIPT
* Jquery
* Media-queries
* Responsive Website
